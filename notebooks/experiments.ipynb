       "\"<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking for the capital of Andhra Pradesh. Let me recall. I know that Andhra Pradesh is a state in India. From what I remember, there was a reorganization of states in India a few years back, and Andhra Pradesh split from Telangana. The original capital of Andhra Pradesh was Hyderabad. But when Telangana became a separate state in 2014, Hyderabad remained the capital of Telangana, so Andhra Pradesh needed a new capital.\\n\\nI think they decided to create a new city for the capital of Andhra Pradesh. What was the name of that city? I think it's Amaravati. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me confirm. Yes, Amaravati is the capital of Andhra Pradesh. But wait, I remember there was some controversy or changes. Maybe there were plans to shift the capital from Hyderabad to a new location. I think the new capital is supposed to be Amaravati, but there might have been delays or some changes in plans. Hmm.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the capital is still Hyderabad for now, but officially it's supposed to be Amaravati. Let me check my facts. The old capital was Hyderabad when Andhra Pradesh was a united state. After Telangana's formation, the capital moved to Amaravati, which is being developed as the new capital. So the current capital is Amaravati, even though the transfer might not be fully completed yet. I should mention that there was a transition from Hyderabad to Amaravati after 2014, and now the capital is Amaravati. I should also note that some government functions might still be in Hyderabad, but the official capital is Amaravati.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of Andhra Pradesh is **Amaravati**. \\n\\n**Key Details:**\\n- **Transition from Hyderabad:** Before 2014, Hyderabad served as the capital of the united Andhra Pradesh. After Telangana became a separate state in June 2014, the capital of Andhra Pradesh was shifted to **Amaravati**, a planned city in the Guntur district.\\n- **Development Status:** Amaravati is still under development as the new capital, with infrastructure projects ongoing. Some government offices and functions remain in Hyderabad temporarily.\\n- **Historical Context:** The capital was officially moved to Amaravati in 2014 to establish a distinct administrative center for Andhra Pradesh following the state's bifurcation.\\n\\nAmaravati is envisioned as a smart, sustainable city and a hub for governance and technology.\""
