       "\"<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking for the capital of Andhra Pradesh. Let me recall. I think the capital is Amaravathi. But wait, I remember reading that there might have been some changes or discussions about shifting the capital. Let me think. Andhra Pradesh was formed in 1953, right? The previous capital was Hyderabad when it was part of the united Andhra Pradesh. But when Telangana was carved out in 2014, the capital was shifted to Amaravathi. Wait, no, actually, when Telangana became a separate state, the capital for the remaining Andhra Pradesh needed to be chosen. I think they started building a new capital called Amaravathi, but maybe it's not fully completed yet. Or maybe the capital is still Hyderabad for now and the new one is under construction. Let me verify. From what I remember, the government has been using Hyderabad as the interim capital, and Amaravathi is the planned capital. But the official capital, according to the government's stance, is Amaravathi. However, the actual administrative functions might still be in Hyderabad. Hmm. I need to make sure. Let me check some key points. The state was formed in 1953 with Kurnool as the first capital, then shifted to Hyderabad. When Telangana was separated, the new capital was supposed to be Amaravathi. But the transfer was supposed to happen in phases. I think the government declared Amaravathi as the capital in 2014, but due to delays in construction, the capital remains Hyderabad for now, with Amaravathi being the planned future capital. So the answer should clarify that Amaravathi is the capital, but Hyderabad serves as the interim capital. Wait, but some sources might say Hyderabad is the capital. Let me confirm. According to the Government of Andhra Pradesh's official website, they state that Amaravathi is the capital. However, in practice, many government offices are still in Hyderabad. So the correct answer is that the capital is Amaravathi, with Hyderabad serving as the interim administrative capital for now. The user might be expecting just the official name, so I should present both aspects to be accurate.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of Andhra Pradesh is **Amaravathi**, which was officially designated as the capital in 2014. However, the administrative functions of the state government are currently operating from **Hyderabad** as an interim measure. This arrangement is in place until the new capital city of Amaravathi, which is under development, is fully operational. \\n\\n### Key Details:\\n- **Official Capital (Planned):** Amaravathi (declared in 2014).  \\n- **Interim Administrative Capital:** Hyderabad (due to delays in Amaravathi's development).  \\n- **Historical Context:** Hyderabad was the capital of the undivided Andhra Pradesh until Telangana's separation in 2014. Kurnool was the first capital of Andhra Pradesh when the state was formed in 1953.\\n\\nFor the most up-to-date status on Amaravathi's development, it's advisable to check recent government announcements or updates.\""
