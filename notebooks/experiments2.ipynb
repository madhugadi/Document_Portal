       "\"<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the capital of Andhra Pradesh is. Let me start by recalling what I know about Indian states. Andhra Pradesh is a state in India, right? I think it's in the southern part. Now, capitals of Indian states... Some I know, like Tamil Nadu's capital is Chennai, Kerala's is Thiruvananthapuram. But Andhra Pradesh... Hmm.\\n\\nWait, I remember that Andhra Pradesh used to have Hyderabad as its capital, but I think there was a change. Oh, right! There was a new capital created after the bifurcation of the old Andhra Pradesh. The old state was split into Telangana and the new Andhra Pradesh. So the old capital, Hyderabad, went to Telangana. Then Andhra Pradesh needed a new capital. I think they built a new city for it. What was the name again? Amravati? Or maybe Amaravati? I'm a bit confused between the two. \\n\\nWait, Amravati is a city in the new Andhra Pradesh, and it's supposed to be the capital. But I also remember that there was some talk about shifting the capital from Visakhapatnam or some other city. No, actually, Visakhapatnam is a major city there, but is it the capital? I think the capital was supposed to be Amaravati. Let me confirm. \\n\\nI think the official capital of Andhra Pradesh is Amaravati. But I should check if there have been any recent changes. Sometimes there are political issues or delays in moving the capital. For example, maybe the government hasn't fully shifted yet. But as of the latest information I have, the capital is Amaravati. Let me make sure. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the capital is still Hyderabad, but I don't think so because when the state was bifurcated in 2014, Hyderabad became the capital of Telangana. So Andhra Pradesh had to choose a new one. The new capital was supposed to be Amaravati. So yes, I think that's it. The capital of Andhra Pradesh is Amaravati. I think that's correct. But I should verify if there's any confusion with Amravati. Wait, Amravati is in the neighboring state of Maharashtra, right? Or is it in Andhra Pradesh? Wait, no, Amravati is in Maharashtra. So maybe the correct name is Amaravati. I think that's the one in Andhra Pradesh. So the capital is Amaravati. I'll go with that.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of Andhra Pradesh is **Amaravati**. \\n\\n**Key Details:**\\n- **History:** After the bifurcation of the original Andhra Pradesh state in 2014 (which led to the creation of Telangana), Amaravati was designated as the capital of the new Andhra Pradesh. \\n- **Location:** It is a planned city in the Guntur district, part of the Andhra Pradesh capital region, which includes surrounding areas like Nellore and Prakasam districts.\\n- **Status:** While the capital was officially shifted to Amaravati, the transition process has faced delays and political debates. However, the government continues to develop the city as the administrative hub.\\n\\n**Note:** Amaravati should not be confused with Amravati (spelled differently), which is a city in Maharashtra and unrelated to Andhra Pradesh.\""

The context talks about how RAG methods are cost-effective and perform better than native LLMs but have limitations. It also mentions that Advanced and Modular RAG address the shortcomings of Naive RAG.\\n\\nAnother part of the context refers to the tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks: retrieval, generation, and augmentation techniques. The documents discuss the progression of RAG systems, including enhancements with LLM fine-tuning and evaluation methods covering tasks, datasets, metrics, and benchmarks.\\n\\nPutting this together, RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It\\'s a method that combines retrieval of information from external sources with the generation capabilities of language models to enhance their responses. The system retrieves relevant documents, uses them to augment the input, and then generates a more informed answer. The context explains different stages of RAG\\'s evolution and its components, which are retrieval, generation, and augmentation. The answer should define RAG in these terms based on the provided information.\\n</think>\\n\\nRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a research paradigm that integrates retrieval techniques with language model (LLM) generation to enhance the accuracy and relevance of responses. It involves three core components: **retrieval** (fetching relevant external information), **generation** (producing answers using the retrieved data), and **augmentation** (combining retrieved content with the model\\'s knowledge). The RAG framework has evolved through stages like Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG, addressing limitations such as cost-effectiveness and performance gaps. Advanced and Modular RAG further refine these systems by incorporating LLM fine-tuning and systematic evaluation methods to tackle challenges in real-world applications.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 401, 'prompt_tokens': 1528, 'total_tokens': 1929, 'completion_time': 0.856724195, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.086236279, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.071080412, 'total_time': 0.942960474}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_d58dbe76cd', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019b6937-ef1b-78d0-be6e-7cadaa4d01d6-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1528, 'output_tokens': 401, 'total_tokens': 1929})"
